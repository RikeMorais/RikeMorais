I always liked complex challenges. Problems that require thinking and creativity are the fuel that moves me towards solutions. Although I like to work in an organized and well-planned way, I can deliver very well under pressure. I can stay focused on any kind of environment and problem.

I usually go into those projects that don't seem to have a solution. I like to create teams from scratch and help in the formation of future leaders. I have been in the technology business for about 10 years and I can say that I still feel as excited about learning as I was 10 years ago.

Even being a Data Specialist, I consider myself a Generalist, I like to know a wide range of options and know how to apply each one of them to your solution properly. I learn very easily and I am passionate. Whenever I join a project, I give myself completely.
